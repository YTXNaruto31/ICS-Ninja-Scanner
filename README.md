## Usage

To use the ICS Ninja Scanner, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python scanner.py --help
```

This command will display all available options and configurations.

### Example Command

Here‚Äôs a basic example of how to run a scan:

```bash
python scanner.py --protocol modbus --target 192.168.1.1
```

This command will initiate a scan on the specified target using the Modbus protocol.

## Configuration

The ICS Ninja Scanner allows you to configure various settings. You can specify:

- **Scan Intensity**: Choose from low, medium, or high.
- **Protocols to Scan**: Select which protocols you want to include in the scan.
- **Output Format**: Choose the format for the generated report (e.g., JSON, CSV).

To configure these settings, edit the `config.json` file located in the root directory.

### Sample Configuration

```json
{
  "scan_intensity": "medium",
  "protocols": ["modbus", "s7"],
  "output_format": "json"
}
```

## Reporting

After running a scan, the ICS Ninja Scanner generates a report detailing the findings. The report includes:

- **Vulnerabilities Found**: A list of detected vulnerabilities.
- **Misconfigurations**: Identified misconfigurations in the system.
- **Recommendations**: Suggested actions to mitigate the identified issues.

You can specify the output location for the report in the command line:

```bash
python scanner.py --output report.json
```
